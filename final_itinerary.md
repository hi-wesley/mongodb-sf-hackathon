# Winter Week in Japan ❄️ (Winter 2026)

A beautiful 7-day itinerary focusing on Tokyo, Hakone, and Kyoto with a restful onsen day and plenty of winter highlights.

## Flights ✈️
- International: Round-trip to Tokyo (Haneda HND or Narita NRT) from your home city. Major nonstop options from US West Coast (LAX/SFO), East Coast (JFK/EWR), and other hubs with ANA, JAL, United, Delta. Typical long-haul durations vary by origin (roughly 10–12h from the West Coast; longer from the East Coast with connections).
- Domestic rails: Shinkansen Tokyo ⇄ Kyoto in about 2h 15m (Nozomi/Hikari services). Optional Hakone loop from Tokyo via Odakyu Romancecar for a scenic hot spring break.
- Tips: For a 7-day rail-centric plan, a single city pass or regional JR passes can be evaluated, but many travelers prefer point-to-point Shinkansen tickets for flexibility.
